This was the era of VR games.\\n\\nI had no hesitation.\\n\\nTo succeed through gaming, I was prepared to give my life. I did anything to accomplish my goals. Everything was fair in the name of success.\\n\\nIn the end, the goal I’ve been striving for was within my reach, just a hair’s breadth away.\\n\\nJust a bit more, just a bit!\\n\\nI could have reached my goal in just a bit more…\\n\\n“Fuckers.”\\n\\nI never thought my comrades would betray me.
